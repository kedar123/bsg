To use Ruby-PayPal
==================
It's critical that you understand how PayPal works and how the PayPal NVP API
works. You should be relatively well-versed in the NVP API Developer Guide and 
Reference (https://www.paypal.com/en_US/ebook/PP_NVPAPI_DeveloperGuide/index.html). 
You should also visit and register yourself with the PayPal Developer Network
and get a Sandbox account with in the PayPal Development Central
(https://developer.paypal.com/). 

Note that this library only supports the API signature method of securing the API credentials.

Using the Ruby-PayPal library is relatively simple:

1. For the Direct Payment using credit card payment, you need to use the
DoDirectPayment APIs:

	username = <PayPal API username>
	password = <PayPal API password>
	signature = <PayPal API signature>
	
	ipaddress = '192.168.1.1' # can be any IP address
	amount = '100.00' # amount paid
	card_type = 'VISA' # can be Visa, Mastercard, Amex etc
	card_no = '4512345678901234' # credit card number
	exp_date = '022010' # expiry date of the credit card
	first_name = 'Sau Sheong'
	last_name = 'Chang'
	
    paypal = Paypal.new(username, password, signature) 
    response = paypal.do_direct_payment_sale(ipaddress, amount, card_type,
			   card_no, exp_date, first_name, last_name)
	if response.ack == 'Success' then
	  # do your thing
	end
	
The above code is for a final sale only.

Note that the credit card number is checked against a modulo-10 algorithm (Luhn check) as well as a simple credit card
type check. For more information please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm and 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_number

2. For the Express Checkout using the customer's PayPal account for payment, you will need to use the ExpressCheckout APIs:
